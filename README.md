# TellMyReps
Helpers for civic action that makes it easier contact your reps.
See it live [here](https://tellmyreps.github.io/).

## Adding a new campaign
You can duplicate `template.html` and change up the `subject`, `template`, and `recipients`.
Don't forget to replace `CAMPAIGN_NAME` and `CAMPAIGN_DESCRIPTION` on the page itself!

You may also want to update `index.html` to add a link to your new campaign!
