## Adding a new campaign
1) Duplicate (and rename) `template.html` 
2) Change up the `subject`, `template`, and `recipients` variables in the script tag.
3) Replace `CAMPAIGN_NAME` and `CAMPAIGN_DESCRIPTION` to tell people what the campaign is and why they should care.
4) Optionally, update `index.html` to add a link to your new campaign!
